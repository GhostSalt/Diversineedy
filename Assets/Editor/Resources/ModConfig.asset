  description: 'In 1974, GS Electronics released a needy module designed to throw
    off defusers with manuals. It could hold up to six custom-built components, which
    could be set to do what the bomb setter wanted them to do. One setter gave it
    lots of different sensors that could detect tampering, but accidentally detonated
    the bomb while installing it. These modules still sometimes appear on modern-day
    bombs, but setters now use pre-made, predictable components.


    Really happy with how this needy turned out! Please play it! Needies are awesome!


    Doesn''t currently have Twitch Plays support, and I''m not sure I want it to have
    it. Too skill-based.'
